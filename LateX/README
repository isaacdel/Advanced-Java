BinaryMathTerm.java - extends mathterm ,represents a term composed of exactly
 two independent math terms.
BracketsMathTerm.java - extends mathterm,represents a math term between
 brackets (See latex's \right( and \left))
FractionMathTerm.java - extends binary mathterm represents a special case of
 binary math term. 
It should be rendered as a fraction ("kav shever" in hebrew).
MathTerm.java - represents the base class for all other MathTerms classes
SimpleBinaryOpMathTerm.java - extends binary mathterm ,represents a simple 
operation between two other terms. For example, "a+b", "c*d" or "c=d","x
SimpleMathTerm.java - extends mathterm,represents a math term which is either
 a single letter variable (x,y,a,b,etc..) or a number
SumMathTerm.java - extends mathterm,represents a mathematical sum.
 It comprised of 3 MathTerms: - Term beneath the sigma sign
*the classes that inherit from mathterm need all of the characteristics 
of a mathterm like 
knowing if its a part of an exp or its barred etc.
*the classes that inherit from binary mathterm usualy "work" with two
 mathterms like fraction so their tolatex
 will print two terms that each one of them 
may be built of few mathterms.
