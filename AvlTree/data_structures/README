this program will create a functioning AVL tree.
=============================
design
=============================
Tree.java -this interface class contains all of the basic  methods that should
be implemented in any kind of tree (add,delete etc..)

BinarySearchTree.java- implements tree.creates a BST from a given data. very
similar to an AVL tree except there is no need to balance the nodes.
(has a Node nested class-described in the q&a)

AvlTree.java-extends BinarySearchTree. this class also contains balancing 
,deleting and adding unique methods that are not required in BST.

AvlIterator.java-implements Iterator. this class is my implementation to 
iterator.its able to throw next val or check if it exist on a given tree.
